This is a sample project that creates a plugin module to GlassFish v5.1 Admin
Console to demonstrate the available Integration Points.  The goal is to
update this project whenever another Integration Point is available.

The plugin jar is available as you check out this project.  If you want to
build your own or rebuild after making modifications, you can perform these 3
steps (otherwise, you can skip this):

    1.  cd project
    2.  mvn install
    3.  cd ..

To install:

    1.  cp project/target/console-sample-ip-plugin.jar  <GFv3-INSTALL>/glassfish/modules/.
    2.  restart the server. 

Access the Console, by default: http://localhost:4848/

You should see the sample tree nodes, tabs, commonTask etc. added to the admin console.
